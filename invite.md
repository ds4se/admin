Dear XXX,

I write to invite you to contribute a (short) chapter to the upcoming Morgan-Kaufmann book, 
"Perspectives on Data Science for Software Engineering" editted by myself and XXXTom Zimmermann, XXXLaurie Williams, 
and XXXTim Menzies.

Many recent texts offer extensive technical details on analyzing software project data. That said,  after last year's
Dagstuhl workshop on Software Analytics, it has become clear that many of the key insights of this diverse field
are not readily accessible to a wider audience.

Accordingly, we write to you for an "insight" chapter; i.e. 1500 words (or less) that comment on
the core insights of our field. At our Dagstuhl seminar, we collected a long list of those insights and
we write to ask if you would be willing to write on

+ XXXX

Our intention is that this book should be broadly accessible. Accordingly, we ask that:

+ The chapter should be short, and to the point.
+ The chapter title should be a mantra; i.e. some slogan reflecting best practice for data science for SE.
+ Chapters should  little or no use of jargon, formula, diagrams, references.
+ Chapters should be approachable and have a clear take away message. 

If it helps, we have written a sample chapter for this book at http://goo.gl/CDDWBX. Please do not
feel compelled to follow the form of that chapter. That said, that chapter includes two features that
might increase its usability:

+ It uses a light hearted story to start the chapter;
+ It offers a list of specific recommendations at the end of the chapter

Our plan is to write this book using peer feedback. 
To allow for easy commenting, all the chapters will be stored in a 
Github repo https://github.com/ds4se/chapters (so we ask that you write your chapter using plain text,
or Github's Markdown syntax). 

(Aside: if you are not used to working with Github, please 
just send me the text of your chapter; otherwise, we will grant you commit permission on that repo.)

I hope you agree to writing for this book. As you can see from the above, the workload associated with
each chapter will not be very large.

Regards,  
XXXX
