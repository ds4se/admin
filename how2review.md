# Reviewer instructions

## Important dates

Unless you've made other arrangements with the editors, reviews are due Nov 23.

## BACKGROUND

For this book, we are experimenting with Github as a reviewing tool.

If you have problems using Github, then don’t use it.
Just email your review to your block editor and they will paste it in for you. 

## Our Review Process


Please note that our review process is *very different* to the standard review process for journals and conferences.

Your role as reviewer is *not* "gate-keeper".

Rather, your goal is to help all authors achieve the same shared goal; i.e. to generate the best book possible that summarizes the state of the art in analyzing software data.

So, short hyper-critical rejections should *not* be written.

IMPORTANT NOTE: In this tool, all reviewers can see all papers and all authors can see their reviewers. So in this review process, **politeness matters**. 


Instead, as part of your review, you need to offer
authors a checklist of things to change in order to
enhance the message of their chapter. Your checklist
should be clear and realistic (so massive new
experimentation or new data collection is not a
useful suggestion).

That said, once you have offered authors your
checklist, if you feel that that a chapter is
fatally flawed, please say so in the private
comments to the review committee. As editors, we
will seriously consider the issues you raise (at,
possibly, reject that chapter).


## BEFORE YOU START

Reviewers  have been divided into blocks of three.  To find your block,
please see [https://goo.gl/WLNUWs](https://goo.gl/WLNUWs)

Each block is managed by one of Laurie, Tim, or Tom. If you have any issues with the following instructions, please talk to your block manager (one of Tim, Tom or Laurie). Our emails are:

- tzimmer@microsoft.com" <tzimmer@microsoft.com>, 
- Laurie Williams <williams@csc.ncsu.edu>,
- tim menzies <tim.menzies@csc.ncsu.edu>

We did reviewer assignment randomly and manually so we need to check for COI issues. Please check your assignments (looking for COI). 

**Notes:**

1. If you have COI issues, contact your block manager.

2.  If you want to change your review assignment, please contact your block manager (but try not to swap to another block).
