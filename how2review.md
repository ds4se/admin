# Reviewer instructions

## Important dates

Unless you've made other arrangements with the editors, reviews are due Nov 23.

## BACKGROUND


For this book, we are experimenting with Github as a reviewing tool.

If you have problems using Github, then don’t use it.
Just email your review to your block editor and they will paste it in for you. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: In this tool, all reviewers can see all papers and all authors can see their reviewers. So in this review process, **politeness matters**. 

(Aside: why are we using Github? Cause Timm is worried about the increasing cost of editorial systems like Cyperchair and Easybhair and wants to explore $0 tools. Also, he is an old hippy  enamored with it and wants to experiment with open science, open source, open comment systems. Finally,  we could not talk him out of it.)

## BEFORE YOU START


Reviewers  have been divided into blocks of three.  To find your block,
please see [https://goo.gl/WLNUWs](https://goo.gl/WLNUWs)

Each block is managed by one of Laurie, Tim, or Tom. If you have any issues with the following instructions, please talk to your block manager (one of Tim, Tom or Laurie). Our emails are:

- tzimmer@microsoft.com" <tzimmer@microsoft.com>, 
- Laurie Williams <williams@csc.ncsu.edu>,
- tim menzies <tim.menzies@csc.ncsu.edu>

We did reviewer assignment randomly and manually so we need to check for COI issues. Please check your assignments (looking for COI). 

**Notes:**

1. If you have COI issues, contact your block manager.

2.  If you want to change your review assignment, please contact your block manager (but try not to swap to another block).
